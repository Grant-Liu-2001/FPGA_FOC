RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 foc_top_i/cartesian2polar_i/rom_a_reg has an input control pin foc_top_i/cartesian2polar_i/rom_a_reg/ADDRARDADDR[9] (net: foc_top_i/cartesian2polar_i/sel[6]) which is driven by a register (foc_top_i/cartesian2polar_i/acca_reg[9]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
